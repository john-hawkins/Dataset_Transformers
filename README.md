Dataset_Transformers
--------------------

This repository contains a collection of functions I use to 
transform data in order to apply machine learning.

This is predominantly about taking data that has a simple
time-series structure and creating the lagged/aggregated 
feature that make it applicable to standard machine learning
approaches.
