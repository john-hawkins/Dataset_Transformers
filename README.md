Dataset_Transformers
--------------------

This repository contains a collection of functions I use to 
transform data in order to apply machine learning.

This is predominantly about taking data that has a simple
time-series structure and creating the lagged/aggregated 
feature that make it applicable to standard machine learning
approaches.


# Examples

In the data directory there is (Run Script)[data/run.sh] to grab the example data set.

After you have executed it you can execute the (python example)[examples/example_one_lagged_features.py]

This will apply the lagging and differences
